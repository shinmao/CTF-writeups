## Thanks  
Thanks to Sean that give me the impressive class abour advanced binary exploitation.

## ROP0
checksec and only find DEP on this program.  
Put /bin/sh in buf2 and ROPchain in buf, when we need rdi, we just need to give him the address of buf2.  
  
## ROP1 
stack pivoting  

Another point worth caring about is that the address of **'/bin/sh\x00'** and also we need to put a clear address of it into rdi; therefore; I put it in the start of buf2!  
  
## ROP2
Only two bytes of rbp can be overwritten.

Modify rbp to pointer to the caller stack frame.  
  
## ROP3  
  
## Heap1
  
## Heap2
